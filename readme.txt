== Description ==

Extends the features of the rich text editor for Wordpress by adding a new button that will allow you to easily browse all you image attachments and insert them into a post/page.  This is not a replacement for the media manager, this simply makes it easier to insert one or more photos into your post or page.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Once on go to your editor and see that their is a new icon
